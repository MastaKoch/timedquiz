## Timed Quiz Assignment
For this assignment, I was supposed to create a timed assessment using javascript, html, and css. This was quite a challenge; there was a lot of moving parts to this.

I had to create a timer that subtracted points if the user guesses wrong answer choice. It had to stop at zero. I also had to manipulate DOM elements and add elements to the screen using javascript. Just to clarify, I did not finish the high score portion of the assignment. If I had successfully completed it, it would have brought the user to a high score page, which would reward them with the time leftover from the quiz as their final high score and a field where they can input their initials and save to the local storage.

## Motivation
I did enjoy styling the page. Front end development is really starting to click with me now that I have had some time to digest the CSS and HTML content. For this assignment, I wanted to really take a unique approach and create a "Retro video-game" kind of vibe.

As you can see, it looks like something out of an 80's arcade game. I take great pride in the aesthetically pleasing video game format of the page.

## Code Style
Mostly javascript for this assignment.
