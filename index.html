            <h2 id="intro">Are you a coder who is ready for the ultimate test? 
                Are you competitive?
                Do you like to win?
                If so, you came to the right place!
                See below for rules to kick some butt and get the highest score!!
            </h2>

            <!-- rules -->
            <div class="rules">
                <h1>Rules</h1>
                <h3>
                    Before you begin the quiz by clicking the button below,
                    please read these rules. When you click the "Begin!" button, 
                    the timer will start and you will be presented with a question.
                    If you answer the question correctly, then your time will not be affected.
                    However, if you answer incorrectly, then your time will be subtracted from the clock.

                    When all of the answers are answered or the timer reaches 0, then it's game over.

                    Once the game ends, you can sign your high score with your initials and it will save into the website.

                    All of the questions are multiple choice. Best of luck and happy coding!!! :)
